Super fun and exiting looking forward for another one.
I realized through this project that Web Developing is all about emotion and problem solving.
The adventure I started is exiting, every day it would be a frustration and it was strange cause I wanted to continue so badly and finish what I have started.
To be honest, when the code was doing what I wanted to do I became euphoric and happy to carry on doing this.
8/10 as a project.
